# Bit Manipulation

## 1. Bitwise Operators

- **&** - bitwise AND takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.

- **|** - bitwise OR takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1.

- **^** - bitwise XOR takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.

- **~** - bitwise NOT takes one number and inverts all bits of it

- **<<** - left shift operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

- **>>** - right shift operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
